I'm currently looking to add in a C++ compilter into VS Code and It's proving difficult and interesting.
I've been following this --> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

The link seems to be the one most important and videos are meh because I haven't been able to find 
any anything that good on YouTube. But since this is probably the main source, then I should be fine if I
follow this. At some points it's hard to understand.
